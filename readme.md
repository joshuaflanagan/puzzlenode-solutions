These are my attempts to solve the problems at http://puzzlenode.com

I'm doing it to get some practice with ruby. If you see something I could be doing better, let me know.

**WARNING** These problems are used as part of the entrance exam for
[Mendicant University](http://university.rubymendicant.com/). If you intend to apply,
you probably should not look at my solutions.
